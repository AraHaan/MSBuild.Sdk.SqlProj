# MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj
**THis is currently a prototype and work-in-progress**

An MSBuild SDK that is capable of producing a SQL Server Data-Tier Application package (.dacpac) from a set of SQL scripts that can be subsequently deployed using SqlPackage.exe. It provides much of the same functionality as the old .sqlproj project format, but is build on top of the new SDK-style projects that were first introduced in Visual Studio 2017.
